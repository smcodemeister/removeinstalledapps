# removeinstalledapps
A BASH script file to find and remove installed apps from the command line

Lets say you want to find all the installed apps with vnc in their name

1] Create a bash script file (I called mine removethis.sh)
2] Make it executable : chmod +x removethis.sh
3] Execute this comand: ./removethis.sh vnc
